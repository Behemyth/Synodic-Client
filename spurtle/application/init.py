"""Shared startup preamble for frozen and CLI entry points.

Encapsulates the one-time initialisation that both
:mod:`spurtle.application.bootstrap` (PyInstaller / MSIX) and
:mod:`spurtle.application.qt` (CLI / dev-script) perform
before the GUI event loop starts:

1. Seed user config from the build config (one-time propagation).
2. Register the ``spurtle://`` URI protocol handler (no-op under MSIX).
3. Synchronise the Windows auto-startup state (no-op under MSIX).

Heavy dependencies (PySide6, porringer) are **not** imported here so
that the bootstrap path can call this before loading them.
